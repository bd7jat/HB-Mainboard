1/fixed usart send bug ,make sure send and receive action will not happen at the same time 
2/decrease usart send length down to 32 bytes
11:49 2017/9/14
add power calibrate function,the highest bit of base data is used as a sign ,1 stands for negetive, 0 stands for postive, when the upper master sends calibrate datas ,pay attention to base data , the biggest data of base should be less than 0x8000
16:34 2017/9/15
calibrate function done ,only calibrate current data
14:52 2017/9/29
increase current calibrate B value from 3000 to 8000
